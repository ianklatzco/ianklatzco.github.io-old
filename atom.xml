    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my school&rsquo;s yearly events is a bridge competition put on by the science department and sponsored by a relatively successful construction company full of alumni. It&rsquo;s been running some twenty-odd years, and my physics teacher dangled tasty extra credit in front of our class in exchange for a competent bridge.</p>

<p>So I partnered up and we built a bridge, and then another bridge because we had the spare parts and felt like it.</p>

<p>As it turns out, we didn&rsquo;t RTFM well enough (have I mentioned that&rsquo;s what I have on my class ring?) and neither of the bridge qualified as they were. Some quick on-site edits (while decked out in a suit no less, captured by a friend sneakily snapping pics of me) rendered at least one of the bridges qualified, and we ended up holding a decently-respectable four bricks before the bridge broke. Not quite as stellar as we&rsquo;d hoped, but certainly better than not being able to test the bridges at all.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m happy that we learned the lesson of READ THE FRAKKING INSTRUCTIONS in a relatively low-stakes, mostly for-fun scenario such as this one. Better now than in some more exciting competition later down the road.</p>

<p>At the same time — not reading the instructions? I&rsquo;m embarrased. Our bridge was certainly better than my attempts freshman and sophomore years (paltry three-hour attempts cobbbled togther the night before, as opposed to actual collaborative 6hr fun making them), but not reading the instructions seems like such a terrible mistake to make. Never again.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>//pics of completed tables.</p>

<p>It was a massive effort (much bigger than I anticipated) that ended up taking a cumulative 200 man-hours, 40 of my own.</p>

<p>The project was constructing from scratch three massive, handicap-accessible picnic tables for this really awesome place called Misericordia (my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misericordia_Home">first-ever wikipedia page!</a>). It&rsquo;s a super-cool not-for-profit organization that does some really awesome things for a lot of people with disabilites.</p>

<p>We ran into many bumps on the way, like not having all the wood, bolts, or washers, or splitting wood, but we more or less mitigated every problem pretty quickly by sending my dad out to pick up whatever we were missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rdquo; being the horde of young scouts and adult leaders that came and helped out.</p>

<p>//pics</p>

<p>I learned quite a few things about working with a lot of people — chiefly, organizing people is REALLY HARD — and I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how everything turned out.</p>

<p>We installed the tables at Misericordia&rsquo;s main campus, where they will sit unused until the spring comes. But before then, I&rsquo;ve gotta finish my Eagle Book, the binder reporting on the entire project.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a ton of work, but I&rsquo;m happy that it&rsquo;s nearly done, and I&rsquo;m really hopeful that the tables will see some use and appreciation in the years to come.</p>

    <id>http://klatz.co/blog/mysterious-mic-grate-on-apple-earbuds</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever noticed that Apple&rsquo;s signature earbuds have integrated microphones? There&rsquo;s a small grate of sorts on the back of the volume control switch attached to the standard TRRS earbuds (those with an extra ring on the jack) which seems to signify that there&rsquo;s some sort of mic contained within.</p>

<p>I happened to have a pair of well-loved, fairly beaten-up earbuds that have a crack in the middle of the switch. Naturally, they had to be dismantled. But what I found inside was a bit surprising.</p>

<p>It seems as if the microphone grate&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t actually lead anywhere. I guess the mic is still there, underneath the plastic, but that it doesn&rsquo;t actually need any holes to let sound in. That&rsquo;s pretty Apple.</p>

    <updated>2014-03-07T23:20:09-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://klatz.co/blog/playing-with-the-experiment-on-google-ios-site</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking at <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io">Google IO&rsquo;s website</a> (mostly with info for last year, so this is admittedly dated) I noticed an easter egg of sorts, a pretty Javascript application mysteriously titled <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/experiment">&ldquo;/experiment&rdquo;</a>. The first thing you notice is the fact you can click on the I&rsquo;s and the O&rsquo;s. The next is that your inputs are tracked on the bottom of the screen. And then you noticed that there are right inputs and wrong inputs.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SoDk97S.png" alt="io experiment" /></p>

<p>So naturally I play around a bit, finding two combinations: 01010011, which yields a pixelated version of the IO logo and is named eight-bit according to the url. Next I found 10001000, which shows the &ldquo;synth&rdquo; module.</p>

<p>I google a binary-to-text convert and found that these represented some interesting values — the convert return HTML special character codes — nor did they seem particularly relevant. 0101001 yields &ldquo;S&rdquo;, whereas 10001000 yields &ldquo;&#710;&rdquo;, a circumflex (hooray for new words).</p>

<p>Naturally, I had to know more. I creatively googled &ldquo;google io experiment&rdquo; and found the <a href="https://github.com/Instrument/google-io-2013">GitHub page</a>. Yay open source! Using GitHub&rsquo;s search bar, I plugged in the first number set (01010011) and found a list of <a href="https://github.com/Instrument/google-io-2013/blob/fe814b62e68fcd5db481d348a2ae0fdb2a6f6d4a/js/mode.js">all possible combinations</a>. (Conveniently commented in, too, I might add. Else I might&rsquo;ve never found them :3). Some of the inputs appear to not be accepted (notably 10101010, reportedly the &ldquo;metaball&rdquo; mode, and 10010110, the &ldquo;donut&rdquo; mode, and a few look as if they might have minor bugs (mentioned in the comments for the first batch, lines 65-69, plus I noticed some visual effects in Eight Bit), but the rest appear to be in working order. My favorite one is SpaceMode, 00101010.</p>

    <link href="http://klatz.co/blog/building-a-cheap-valentines-day-card-audio-circuit/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-22T19:43:39-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://klatz.co/blog/building-a-cheap-valentines-day-card-audio-circuit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two weeks before Valetine&rsquo;s Day, I got the idea of making a Zelda-themed card for a friend of mine. She and I are both big Zelda fans. I searched the web for a  card, until I found <a href="(http://blog.close-encounters.com.au/2013/02/normal-0-false-false-false.html">this one</a> that I liked because of the extra dimensions. It seems that the pop-up style heart container card is a pretty popular one overall, and this is one of many.</p>

<p>I decided to take it another step, incoporating some of my (few) electronics skills into the project. To be honest, it was mostly an excuse to order some parts off of Digikey and super-nerdify what would otherwise be a fairly straightforward project. But hey! It was extraordinarily fun.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So did some research for recordable card circuits, and I found <a href="http://hackaday.com/2011/11/22/musical-greeting-card-with-minimal-parts/">this Hackaday post</a> about how to make one on my own. I&rsquo;d been to Digikey&rsquo;s website before, but I had never made an order. Consequently, I had no idea what I was in for. I decided to go through with the project, and ended up ordering all the parts about a week in advance. After a minor issue with shipping a lithium-ion battery through UPS and <em>actually finding everything</em>, I got the parts on the Thursday night before Valentine&rsquo;s Day. I had some debugging left to do, so it was a fairly long night. It was by all means worth it.</p>

<p>The card itself is a relatively simple papercraft model, with some space inside to fit components. I printed it on some cardstock and cut it using an exacto knife.</p>

<h4>About the code</h4>

<p>I had a bit of an educational experience working on the code. I&rsquo;m familiar with Javascript and Python, and I&rsquo;ve worked with Arduino before, but I&rsquo;d never before really wrote new components. I used a modified version of the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Melody">Arduino&rsquo;s Melody example code</a>. Initially, I tuned the values with a tuning application (Instuner on the App Store) for the piezo buzzer, and added flat/sharp notes, as well as some notes an octave up I&rsquo;d need to play the bit of music. The code, more or less the same but with tuned values, is <a href="https://github.com/ianklatzco/melody_revised">on GitHub</a>. I then manually wrote transcribed the notes from some sheet music of the specific tune into the code, resulting in <a href="https://github.com/ianklatzco/melody_revised/blob/master/zelda_chest_noise.ino">this</a>.</p>

<h4>Hardware and writing the code to the ATtiny</h4>

<p>The electronics components were a bit trickier. I ordered about $5 in parts (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/bJdj4Qz.png">parts list</a>) along with some spare ATtinies for future projects. Initially, I thought that I would use a piezo buzzer and reed switch in the circuit, but in the end I opted for a speaker I had on hand (16ohm, 0.5w, salvaged from a similar, pre-recorded greeting card with a ROM) and a regular (SPST) switch (salvaged from the inside of a vending machine). Here&rsquo;s a photo of the (poorly drawn) circuit diagram:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0ULfMSj.jpg" alt="circuit diagram" />
Here&rsquo;re some of the parts:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QpoaPIs.jpg" alt="parts" /></p>

<p>I connected pins 0 and 1 on the ATtiny to the speaker and switch, respectively. After soldering everything in place, I decided that the reed switch was too difficult to align, so I swapped it for the SPST. I wrote the final version of the code to the ATtiny (or so I thought), connected the battery, and everything looked like it was good to go.</p>

<p>Suddenly, an eerie croaking noise came out of the speaker, audibly changing tones but doing so very slowly. As it was already about midnight at that, I panicked. I guessed the issue was the clock rate on the chip — I tested the code on the Arduino, which boasts a 20MHz crystal, as opposed to the ATtiny, which has a paltry 1MHz. A quick google search found a <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/7859/how-do-i-set-the-clock-speed-fuses-on-an-attiny85-when-using-an-arduino-as-a-pro">Stack Exchange</a> post that told me that I should multiply all values by a factor of sixteen, which worked splendidly. The notes were out of tune, and the croaking sounds remained, but it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as before. The final code is also <a href="https://github.com/ianklatzco/melody_revised/blob/master/zelda_chest_noise_x16.ino">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h4>Using the Arduino as an ISP (to program the ATtiny)</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mtKQXWc.jpg" alt="programming" />
In order to program the ATtiny, I used the Arduino. I followed the guide at <a href="http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695">highlowtech.org</a> and it worked, if not with a few hiccups. Initially, I was pushing the ATtiny and a socket down into the breadboard, before I realized that the ATTiny could be pushed directly into it.</p>

<h4>Final Product</h4>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ansXraLD05M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p>I have to thank two friends of mine, who provided awesome help throughout this project. Both who work in the tech industry. If you&rsquo;re a high school student, you should definitely try to communicate with professionals who work in positions you&rsquo;d like to have. If you&rsquo;re a professional, you should be open to helping kids pursue their interests. The relationships I&rsquo;ve developed have been extremely beneficial.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Hilarious Side Note</h4>

<p>Listening to serial communication is the coolest thing ever. It sounds a bit like a dial-up modem.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a Meatheads burger joint opened up just down the street from my house. As a method of celebrating my first driver&rsquo;s license and to say fareweall to the pair of Lithuanians that had stayed with us through the week, we decided to go get some lunch.</p>

<p>While there, I noticed a pair of those snazzy new Coke machines, the kind that let you pick a multitude of flavors and mix it with various popular beverages. My brother reminded me that we had found the admin panel on a previous visit, so we decided to look for it again.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/auJEpJe.jpg" alt="coke machine pic" /></p>

<p>The dispenser appears to have some sort of touch screen (resistive? capacitive?) that&rsquo;s something of a pain to actually use.</p>

<p>Acessing the admin panel is pretty straightforward. All you have to do is select the water icon/bubble, place five fingers around it on the screen, and then mash it until a loading box appears. From that screen you can see the current levels of the various syrups that make up the myriad drinks available.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t really do much with the screen, since the actual access panels (Admin, Technician, Supplier I believe) are locked with a password. But it&rsquo;s certainly fun doing some harmless sneaking about.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of it being done.</p>

    <link href="http://klatz.co/blog/why-1-1-ipad-programs-suck/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-07T17:43:02-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://klatz.co/blog/why-1-1-ipad-programs-suck</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I consider myself a pretty efficient worker when I get down to it. Not that I work all the time (actually, I don&rsquo;t work much of the time, but that&rsquo;s another issue), but that I work with optimal utilization of available resources (read: I like configuring my gadgets to help me do things). It comes from a childhood of ample freedom with tech, in that my father always let me to take things from him and put them into the most useful form. Beyond that, I like technology. Hell, I love technology, and the productivity boosts it offers. So you might imagine my elation when my school announced it would begin a 1:1 iPad program starting this year.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Bias against Apple aside, I had always entertained the notion of walking into my classes with a computing device. The particular draw was the ability to record homework assignments into <a href="http://www.wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a> (which, as you can see below, has grown of of control pretty quickly). I dreamed of a day where I could freely check my email, google an unknown topic, or zero my RSS feeds on the fly—and that day came.</p>

<p>But it came with more inconveniences than I could have ever imagined. There are two major problems.</p>

<ul>
<li>Books <strong>must</strong> be on iPads. (Apparently the administration that approved the program never knew this would be a requirement.)</li>
<li>The tech policy is incredibly vague.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6bFnaKI.jpg" alt="silliness" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my iPad for composition. One monitor has a screenshot of my ipad for the assignment. Another my todo list and the book page itself, the pages also screenshots.</p>

<p>I fail to see how this is more efficient than a book and a notebook and an assignment book. The amount of underlying infrastructure that I have setup to get everything running is utterly ridiculous. Granted, I love typing instead of writing, but the point stands. Notability, Dropbox>Camera Uploads, iOS running on two devices that need to be plugged in at the same time, all of this is absurd. I consider myself technologically-inclined. But I&rsquo;m overwhelmed at the amount of setup I need to compensate for the complexities of the iPad program. I can hardly imagine the struggles it causes for people who aren&rsquo;t technologically inclined. After one teacher mentioned that he had heard of one student whose parents bought him two iPads (one for the book, another for note taking), I seriously considered it.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I am inclined to overcomplicating things, and I tend to be a bit spoiled technology-wise, and I very well might be overcomplicating this. But I think it&rsquo;d be pretty difficult to simplify the setup to not use two screens. Switching between Notability and the textbook is a pain.</p>

<p>I would be perfectly content with a book, or digital book applications that didn&rsquo;t suck. The vast majority of them are buggy or full of DRM.</p>

<p>Now, iPads are extraordinarily convenient in that they&rsquo;re light. I&rsquo;ve opted for an extraordinarily light backpack, instead of my usually excessively hefty one. I never go to my locker anymore. I rarely forget books, since the majority of them are on my iPad. On the other hand, however, when the internet goes down, I lose half of my books. Because DRM sucks.</p>

<p>I appreciate my relatively conservative school&rsquo;s attempts to remain at the forefront of tech adoption. But trying to depend on a system that&rsquo;s not really there doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
